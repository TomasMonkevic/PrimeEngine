### What is this repository for? ###

PrimeEngine is a C++ (OpenGL) game engine wannabe, intended for improving my C++ skills, learning computer graphics and 3D algorithms. Currently, PrimeEngine is in very early stages of development, so it still has a lot of bugs and some code parts are simply said - "not good". With each commit, PrimeEngine improves and one day I hope it will be a usable game engine API with features such as:
- fast 2D rendering (with textures)
- 2D physics
- font rendering
- audio system
- optimistically 3D rendering
