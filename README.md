### What is this repository for? ###

PrimeEngine is a C++ (OpenGL) cross-platform game engine. Currently, PrimeEngine is in very early stages of development, so it still has a lot of bugs and some unfinished systems. With each commit, PrimeEngine improves and one day, I hope, it will be a usable game engine.

* Cross-platform support (Windows, Linux, and Android)
* 2D batch rendering
* 3D rendering - with Phong lights and normal maps support
* ASCII text rendering
* .obj model importer
* GameObject/Component based system

### To do list ###

* UI system
* Audio
* 2D physics
* 3D physics
